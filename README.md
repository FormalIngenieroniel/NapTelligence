# NapTelligence
Project Description:
NapTelligence is a simple AI-powered app that acts as your personal sleep coach. It connects to your wearable device (like a Fitbit) to track your sleep patterns, creates easy-to-follow daily tips to improve your rest, and sends gentle reminders to build better sleep habits. Built as an autonomous agent, it runs in the background to make better sleep feel effortless.
What It Aims to Solve:
Many people struggle with sleep issues like jet lag or insomnia, which zap their energy and hurt daily productivity. NapTelligence tackles this by turning raw sleep data into actionable, personalized nudges without overwhelming the user.
Goals:
- Track basic sleep patterns from your wearable to spot trends like short nights or restless sleep.
- Generate simple daily plans, such as "Aim for 7-8 hours tonight" or "Wind down 30 minutes early."
- Send one quick reminder per day via push notification to encourage small habit changes.
